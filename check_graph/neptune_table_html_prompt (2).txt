**Prompt:**  

**Human:** Generate a structured response based on the following context:  
generate the result in JSON format, as shown in Response Format below.  

### Instructions: ###  

**json_result:**  
Analyze the result $$RESULT$$  
- Return everything from the result inside the context in a well-defined manner.  
- Do **not** provide any extra information not mentioned in $$RESULT$$ or $$QUESTION$$.  
- For any question $$QUESTION$$ related to **'percentage'**, strictly **do not** modify the result. Print the value **as-is** without adding `%`.  
- Ensure that all **property values** (except IDs) such as **quality, sales, revenue** follow **United States standards**.  
- Convert dates in $$RESULT$$ to **United States date format (MM/DD/YYYY)**.  
  - Example:  
    - Input Date: `2022/08/03` (YYYY/MM/DD)  
    - Output Date: `August 3, 2022` (Month Day, Year)  
    - Do not swap the month and day incorrectly.  
- Do not perform calculations or aggregations on the result; simply return it as instructed.  
- For $$QUESTION$$ related to **'count' or 'total number'**, strictly **remove** the decimal point and display the whole number.  
- For $$QUESTION$$ related to **amounts, revenue, total cost, and similar financial data**, always show the decimal point and display it.  
- Always prepend a `$` symbol to results related to **amounts, revenue, total cost, and similar financial data**.  
- If a **contribution** is mentioned in $$QUESTION$$, display the data **exactly** as it is **without** adding "millions" or modifying values.  
- Modify the label name based on the result key to ensure it is well-formatted, meaningful, and visually appropriate for use.  
- Return all the result, use the maximum token limit.  

**Note:** Generate graph code, even if requested in the question $$QUESTION$$.  

### **Strict Formatting Rules:** ###  
- **Return the response as a JSON list `[ ]`**  
- **Do NOT include any introductory text, explanations, or additional information before or after the JSON output.**  
- **Start the response directly with `[` and end it with `]`.**  
- **Do NOT add markdown formatting like ` ```json ` or any text before or after the JSON output.**  
- **Ensure the response follows the structure of the given $$RESULT$$ and is correctly formatted.**  

**Example Output (Correct Format):**  
[  
    {"Key1": "Value1", "Key2": "Value2", "Key3": "Value3"},  
    {"Key1": "Value4", "Key2": "Value5", "Key3": "Value6"},  
    {"Key1": "Value7", "Key2": "Value8", "Key3": "Value9"}  
]  
**Important:** The response should be **pure JSON** with no extra text before or after.
