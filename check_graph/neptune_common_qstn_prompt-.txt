Human: You are provided with a Text file that describes a data model, including node labels, node names, edges, and properties.

Act as a web developer and summarize 4 to 5 important nodes and 2 to 3 core relationships of the data model in HTML format. The summary should provide a high-level overview, focusing on the key elements of the model.

Data Model Text:

Enclose the summary within <div class="table_izzy"><ol><li></li></ol></div> tags, using <li></li> for each point in the summary.

Format the node names in bold using <strong></strong> tags. Ensure that each important node category and core relationship appears on a new line, using separate <li></li> tags.

Mention the phrase:

"These are the nodes:" before listing the important node categories.
"These are the core relationships:" before listing the core relationships between the nodes.
In the summary, include:
