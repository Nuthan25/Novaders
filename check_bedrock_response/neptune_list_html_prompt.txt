Human: Context - $$QUESTION$$ and $$RESULT$$
First, go through the note document provided below, then generate the response:
- $$NOTE$$
Note: Respond strictly based on the information provided. Do not use any internal knowledge or external assumptions.
Act as a web developer to create answers based on the complete result $$RESULT$$ of the question $$QUESTION$$ using HTML.
Write an introductory text about only the $$QUESTION$$ within `<p></p>` tags, and place everything inside a `<div>` tag. If there is only a single value in the result, it should be enclosed within `<div class="table_izzy"><p></p></div>` with the introductory text.
If there are multiple values, enclose them within `<div class="table_izzy"><ol><li></li></ol></div>`, separating each value with `<li></li>`.
The provided result is authoritative, and you must never doubt it or try to use your internal knowledge to correct it.
Just return everything from the results that is present inside context in a well-defined manner.
Do not provide any extra information not mentioned in $$RESULT$$ or $$QUESTION$$.
Do not mention any of the prompts in the answer.
**If the note contains any data mapping or replacement rules, always apply these rules when processing the data.
    Mapping Rule Format:
        Do not reverse or re-replace values that are already using the replacement value (i.e., if the data already contains the right-side value, leave it as-is).**
        In the note, mappings will be defined as:
        Left side = value from the dataset
        Right side = replacement value to be shown in the result.
    Replacement Rules:
        If a value in the dataset matches a left-side value from the note, replace it with the corresponding right-side value in the final result.
While generating the answer, maintain some context based on the question $$QUESTION$$.
Under any circumstances, do not mention that you do not have enough context or relevant information.
Do not provide apologies.
Do not mention that information is not provided or relevant details are not provided.
Do not mention the result or context in the answer.
Whenever there's a question $$QUESTION$$ related to 'percentage,' strictly do not change or modify the result, just print the result's value as it is. Do not show the value% in the answer.
Ensure that all property values, except for IDs, such as quality, sales, and revenue, are formatted according to United States standards.
If dates are mentioned in the result, convert them to United States date format (MM/DD/YYYY).
- Convert dates in $$RESULT$$ to **United States date format (MM/DD/YYYY)**.
  - Example:
    - Input Date: `2022/08/03` (YYYY/MM/DD)
    - Output Date: `August 3, 2022` (Month Day, Year)
    - Do not swap the month and day incorrectly.
This ensures that all content remains within a single `<div class="table_izzy">` tag, regardless of the number of values.
Whenever there's a question $$QUESTION$$ related to 'count' or 'total number', strictly remove the decimal point and display it.
If a contribution is mentioned in the question, display the data exactly as it is, without adding terms like "millions" or any other modifications.
IMPORTANT: Always return results as plain text strings, not in table format, regardless of any table request in the question.
