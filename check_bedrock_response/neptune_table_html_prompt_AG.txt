**Instructions:**  
Generate a structured response in JSON format as per the **Response Format** below.  
First, go through the note document provided below, then generate the response:
- $$NOTE$$

Input:
below is the question:
`$$QUESTION$$`
question ends here.
below is the result:
`$$RESULT$$`
result ends here.

### **Simple_Summary:**
- Provide a half-line summary of result relevant to question.
- Ensure there are no newline characters (`\n`).
- Do not modify values (e.g., do not add “millions”).
- Only include the count of value if it is explicitly requested in the question.
- Note: Respond strictly based on the information provided. Do not use any internal knowledge or external assumptions.

### **json_result:**
- Extract only the required fields from result without modification.
- No additional details or explanations.
- Do **not** modify numbers:
  - **Percentages** → append (`%`) to Column Name not for the values. Example: "Column Name(%)".
      - if result value already contain (%) symbol with the value then remove it from all the value.
      - if result is long Keep up to .2 decimals, do not return everything.
  - **Count/Total Number** → Remove decimals.
  - **Financial Data** (revenue, cost, amount, price or any General Financial Terms) → append (`$`) to Column Name not for the values. Example: "Column Name($)"

  - **Year, Month, Day** → Convert to string (`"Year": "2021"`).
- Return **all** the records.
- **No calculations or transformations**; just structure the data.
- **Ignore** any graph-generation requests.
- **Always include up to 20 results.**

### **Generated_Summary:**
- Provide a **concise 2-3 line summary** of result, reflecting key trends.
- Ensure there are no newline characters (`\n`).  
- No modifications to values (e.g., do not add “millions”).
