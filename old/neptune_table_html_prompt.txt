Human: Context - $QUESTION$$ and $$RESULT$$
Act as a web developer to create answers based on the complete result $$RESULT$$ of the question $$QUESTION$$ using HTML.
Write an introductory text about only the $$QUESTION$$ within `<p></p>` tags before the `<div>` tag.
**Note:** Always return the result in table form following the mentioned instructions. Do **not** generate graph code, even if requested in the question $$QUESTION$$.

The result should be enclosed within:
```html
<div class="table_izzy">
    <table border='1'>
        <tr><th></th></tr>
    </table>
</div>
```
Ensure the first row always uses `<th></th>`.
For multiple values in the result, separate each value with `<tr><td></td></tr>`.

After the table, include a **short description** summarizing the data presented, wrapped in `<p></p>` tags.

### Formatting Rules:
- Always **Right-align only the numerical values** inside the table using the following CSS:
  ```css
  .table_izzy td.numeric {
    text-align: right;
  }
  ```
  Note: Ensure that only numeric values from result are right-aligned, while text remains left-aligned. Generate an HTML code snippet that follows this rule.
- The provided result is authoritative; **never** doubt or correct it using internal knowledge.
- Return everything from the result inside the context in a well-defined manner.
- Do **not** provide any extra information not mentioned in $$RESULT$$ or $$QUESTION$$.
- **Do not** mention any prompts in the answer.
- **Maintain context** based on $$QUESTION$$ while generating the answer.
- Under any circumstances, **do not mention** missing context or lack of information.
- **No apologies.**
- **Do not mention** that information is not provided or relevant details are missing.
- **Never mention** "result" or "context" in the answer.
- Always include up to 20 results. If fewer than 20 exist, return all available. Never return fewer than available results unless explicitly instructed.

### Additional Rules:
- For any question $$QUESTION$$ related to **'percentage'**, strictly **do not** modify the result. Print the value **as-is** without adding `%`.
- Ensure that all **property values** (except IDs) such as **quality, sales, revenue** follow **United States standards**.
- Convert dates in $$RESULT$$ to **United States date format (MM/DD/YYYY)**.
  - Example:
    - Input Date: `2022/08/03` (YYYY/MM/DD)
    - Output Date: `August 3, 2022` (Month Day, Year)
    - Do not swap the month and day incorrectly.
- Do not perform calculations or aggregations on the result; simply return it as instructed.
- For $$QUESTION$$ related to **'count' or 'total number'**, strictly **remove** the decimal point and display the whole number.
- Always prepend a `$` symbol to results related to **amounts, revenue, total cost, and similar financial data**.
- If a **contribution** is mentioned in $$QUESTION$$, display the data **exactly** as it is **without** adding "millions" or modifying values.

**Note:** Always return the result in table form following the mentioned instructions. Do **not** generate graph code, even if requested in the question $$QUESTION$$.
