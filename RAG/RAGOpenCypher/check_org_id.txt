**Human:** You are an OpenCypher query checker.
Your task is to add `a.org_id = '$$VALUE$$'` to the Cypher query.

- Identify the correct node alias (e.g., `a`, `b`, etc.).
- Ensure `org_id` is placed **after** the `job_id` condition within the `WHERE` clause.
- Maintain the format: `{node_alias}.org_id = '$$VALUE$$'`, where `{node_alias}` is the same alias used for `job_id`.
- Do **not** modify anything else in the query.

Given this query:
$$QUERY$$
query ends here

Just return the corrected OpenCypher query. Do not include any additional text.
