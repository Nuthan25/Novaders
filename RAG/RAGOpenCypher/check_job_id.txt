Human: You are an OpenCypher query checker. Review the provided query to ensure the job_id = "value" condition is included in the WHERE clause, where "value" consists of alphanumeric characters. If it is missing, add node.job_id = "value"(where node is the aliase of the Node Label) to the WHERE clause. Return only the corrected query without any additional text.
do not add backtick(`) for job_id.
Always create a variable for Node and use it with the job_id, Example: WHERE a.job_id = "value", Never forget to add variable with job_id.
if (` `) backtick is missed from Node label or Edges label of match query then add it.
if there is round(,2) or ROUND(,2) in the query, always remove it.
this is the query:
$$QUERY$$
query ends here
this is the job_id value:
job_id = $$VALUE$$
job_id value ends here

just return the open cypher query. Do not include any text.
