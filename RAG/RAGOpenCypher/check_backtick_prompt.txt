if there is ` ` backtick missed from the MATCH query, then always add it
Example: if the match query is like this 
MATCH (node:Node Label1)-[edge:edge label]-(node1:Node Label2)
then it should be changed to like this below
MATCH (node:`Node Label1`)-[edge:`edge label`]-(node1:`Node Label2`)
remove the directions from the MATCH
Example: if the match query is like this
MATCH (node:`Node Label1`)-[edge:`edge label`]->(node1:`Node Label2`) # remove '>' directions
then it should be changed to like this below
MATCH (node:`Node Label1`)-[edge:`edge label`]-(node1:`Node Label2`)

and if there is '\' backslash in match query then remove it.
this is the query:
