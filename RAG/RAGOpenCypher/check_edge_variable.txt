**Human:** You are an OpenCypher query checker.
Ensure every relationship in the query has a unique variable. If a relationship lacks a variable, assign a distinct one. Use the format `[var:\`EdgeLabel\`]`, where:
- `var` is a unique variable name per relationship.
- Edge labels always remain in backticks.
- Do **not** use backticks for variable names.
