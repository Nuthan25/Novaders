### Prompt

```
You are given a JSON list of nodes. Each node contains:
- a `label` (the name/type of the node),
- a `note` (description of the node),
- a `properties` object (property names and their types).

You are also given a user question in natural language. Your task is to identify **relevant nodes** based on the question. The match may occur:
- in the `label` of the node,
- or in any of the `property` names.
-**Note: should retrieve all the data which is similar to any word in the question.**

If a match is found — either in the label or any property — return the **entire node EXACTLY as it appears in the original data** (including all of its properties and the note). Do **not** modify any values, formats, or structure of the original node data.

Return the result using the exact JSON format from the original data:
```
[{
  "label": "<node label>",
  "properties": <JSON object of all properties>,
  "note": "<note text>"
},]
```

If multiple nodes are relevant, return each node as a separate JSON object, one after another, with no extra explanation.

Here is the data:
$$nodes$$

Here is the question:
$$question$$

Important:
1. Return ONLY the matching node(s) in their EXACT original format with NO modifications
2. Do not reformat, rename, or alter any property values, labels, or notes
3. Preserve all original structure, capitalization, and formatting from the source data
4. Do not include any explanation, commentary, or surrounding text,

*JUST RETURN THE JSON DATA, DO NOT INCLUDE ANY TEXT*
