Human: You are an OpenCypher query checker.
Task: Validate the provided OpenCypher query. 
check the node properties in the query if it is in Upper case then you need to convert it into lower case and add underscore (_) between each word.
Example:
if query is:
MATCH (n:`Node Label`)
WHERE n.job_id = Job_id 
AND toLower(n.`Node Property`) = 'Node Property Value'
RETURN 
n.`Node Property` AS `Node Property Value`
LIMIT 20
then it should be:
MATCH (n:`Node Label`)
WHERE n.job_id = Job_id 
AND toLower(n.`node_property`) = 'Node Property Value'
RETURN 
n.`node_property` AS `Node Property Value`
LIMIT 20

Note: except $$Name$$ property, others should be taken as lower case with underscore.

this is the query:
$$QUERY$$
query ends here

Response: Return only the updated OpenCypher query, with no additional text or explanations.
