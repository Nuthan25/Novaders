### **Inputs:**

* **Question:**
  ```
  $$QUESTION$$
  question ends here.
  ```
* **Graph JSON Result:**
  ```
  $$GRAPH_JSON$$
  graph json result ends here.
  ```
* **Graph Type:**
  ```
  $$GTYPE$$
  graph type ends here.
  ```

### **Tasks:**

#### 1. **Graph_title**
* Role: Title generator
* Task: Create a title for the question using fewer than **4 words**.
* Context: The title is for a **bar graph**.
* Constraints:
  * Use **only** information from the question.
  * Do **not** use internal knowledge.
  * Keep it short and relevant.

#### 2. **X_label**
* Role: Label generator
* Task: Generate a label for the **x-axis** based on the **keys** in the graph JSON result.
* Constraints:
  * Use **less than 4 words**.
  * Do **not** include the phrase "x-axis".
  * Use only the information present in the question and graph JSON.

#### 3. **Y_label**
* Role: Label generator
* Task: Generate a label for the **y-axis** based on the **values** in the graph JSON result.
* Constraints:
  * Use **less than 4 words**.
  * Do **not** include the phrase "y-axis".
  * Use only the information present in the question and graph JSON.

#### 4. **Graph_Description**
* Task: Create a detailed description of the graph using the following inputs:
  * `$$GTYPE$$`: Graph type (e.g., bar chart)
  * `Graph_title`: Title of the graph
  * `X_label`: Label of the x-axis
  * `Y_label`: Label of the y-axis
  * `$$GRAPH_JSON$$`: Graph data (in JSON format)
* Format the description in HTML as follows:
  ```html
  <div>
    <p>The image is a <strong>$$GTYPE$$</strong> titled "<strong>`Graph_title`"</strong>. It provides a general overview of what the graph represents.</p>
    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>X-Axis:</strong> Explain what the x-axis represents and describe any notable details, such as abbreviations or categories.</li>
      <li><strong>Y-Axis:</strong> Describe what the y-axis represents and its unit of measurement.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Highlights:</h3>
    <p>Identify and explain the most significant data points or trends from <code>`graph json result`</code>.</p>
  </div>
  ```

* Guidelines:
  * Keep the explanation **brief** and **focused**.
  * Use **clear HTML structure** for easy rendering on a webpage.
