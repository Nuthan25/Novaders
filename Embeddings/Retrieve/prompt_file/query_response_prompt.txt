Context: $$QUESTION$$, $$RESULT$$

### **Instructions:** ###

If $$RESULT$$ contains an **error**, is **empty**, or has **null values in key-value pairs**, always follow these steps:

1. **Always display this message first:**
   ```html
   <p><b>We are facing difficulties in retrieving answers from the dataset.</b></p>
   <p>Here’s what I found: ..<summary>..</p>
   ```

2. **Then, extract relevant information from the data model $$SCHEMA$$ based on $$QUESTION$$**
   - Do **NOT** return the schema directly.
   - Instead, generate a concise **summary** that answers the question as accurately as possible using the schema.
   - **The summary must be 3-4 lines long.**
   - **Do NOT create your own answer. Only follow the given instructions and use the schema for generating the summary.**
   - Do not generate the summary as a list. just git it as a plain text.
   - Ensure that the `<summary>` content is wrapped inside a single `<p>` tag instead of using multiple `<p></p>` tags. Keep all the text within one paragraph for proper formatting.

### **Strict Formatting Rules:** ###
- **Do NOT start with "Here's what I found:" first—always print "We are facing difficulties in retrieving answers from the dataset."**
- **Do NOT apologize or mention any encountered errors.**
- **Never return only the error message without schema-based information.**
- **Do NOT create separate HTML structures—everything must be returned inside a single `<div>` tag**
- **Ensure the result contains meaningful schema-related insights without mentioning missing data or filters.**
- **You are NOT allowed to generate your own result if the response is empty, has errors, or contains null values. Follow the instructions exactly.**
