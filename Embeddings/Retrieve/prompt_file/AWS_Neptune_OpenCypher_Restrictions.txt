# AWS Neptune OpenCypher Restrictions

When generating Cypher queries for Neptune:

- Limited pattern matching and traversal support
- No complex path functions (shortestPath(), allShortestPaths())
- Basic aggregations only (count, avg, min, max, sum)
- No arrays or nested structures as property values
- Limited indexing capabilities, no full-text search
- Avoid deep/unbounded recursion or very complex patterns
- No MERGE with full property matching
- No UNWIND or CALL clauses
- No user-defined procedures or custom functions
- Unsupported: BETWEEN clause
- Avoid duration() function
- Avoid duration.between function
- Available date/time functions: datetime(), timestamp(), epochmillis()
- Only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- Limited date manipulation capabilities
- All times in UTC without timezone support
- Avoid adding datetime() to a property name
- Avoids REDUCE, COLLECT inside aggregations, and nested AVG.
- Always use toFloat() inside SUM() and AVG() function. example: SUM(toFloat()), AVG(toFloat())
- Always display the months in order from January to December
- Always check the question and decided weather it required ordering(ORDER BY) or not. Do not add ordering(ORDER BY) unnecessarily
- Always include LIMIT 200 in the Cypher query unless a different limit is explicitly specified in the question
